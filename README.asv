If you have any questions, please contact <marcel.bausch.ukb@gmail.com>. All data files and code will be in Matlab format.


### Code
We used Matlab R2021a with the statistics toolbox. To reproduce the figures in the manuscript, start matlab, navigate to the repository-folder and add it to the matlabpath:

```
cd('/Path/to/this/repo');
addpath(pwd);

plot_figure_2E

```


### Data 
all_unitinfo.mat    <- metainfo for each neuron
rmANOVA.mat         <- data of the partial eta squares and p-values obtained by the repeated-measures ANOVA for each neuron
    * all_etas (3 x Nneurons) for the main effect of stimulus, context and stimulus-context
    * all_etas_imperm_boot 3 x Nneurons), same, but obtained by permuting image labels PER question
    * all_etas_qperm_boot 3 x Nneurons), same, but obtained by permuting question labels PER image
    * all_ps (3 x Nneurons)
